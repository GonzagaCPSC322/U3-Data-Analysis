    "[Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) is a markup language to typeset documents. Specifically, Latex is really good at typesetting *math*. We are going to use Latex in our Markdown cells to render beautiful mathematical formulas. How we are going to use Latex only scratches the surface of what Latex can be used for (i.e. writing entire papers, as an alternative to Microsoft Word). \n",
